# Grep-Clone 🔍

A fast, lightweight, and robust command-line utility written in Rust that mimics the behavior of the classic `grep` tool. This project is designed to search for a specific text string or pattern within files and output the matching lines to the console.

## 🚀 Features

* **Fast Pattern Matching:** Quickly scan and search for string patterns inside any text file.
* **Case-Insensitive Search:** Supports toggling case sensitivity (often via environment variables).
* **Safe & Robust:** Built entirely in Rust, guaranteeing memory safety and graceful error handling for missing files or incorrect arguments.
* **Zero Dependencies:** A lightweight project built utilizing standard Rust libraries.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need to have Rust and its package manager, Cargo, installed on your system.
